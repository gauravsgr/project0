        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, as the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.[8]:20–22 He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's westward migration, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[9]:3,4[8]:20 Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln, moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky, in the 1780s.[9]:4 Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786. His children, including eight-year-old Thomas,[10][11] Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.[8]:21[12]:1–2[13]:12–13 Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee, before settling with members of his family in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.[9]:5[8]:21. Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26. The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.[121] The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing[121]:31–58[122]:231–238 or in silent grief. Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.[123] African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'.[124]:164 In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.[124]:197–199 Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.
